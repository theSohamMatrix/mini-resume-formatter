# 📝 Mini Resume Formatter

This is a small Python project where I created a mini resume generator. The program takes input like your name, degree, skills, and contact info, and then displays a neat and clean resume layout in the terminal.

It was a fun way for me to practice Python basics like string formatting, input functions, and working with user data.

## 📌 What it does:

- Takes your name, education, skills, and other details
- Formats everything like a mini resume
- Shows the output in a clean and organized way

## 🛠 Tools used:

- Python
- Input functions
- String methods and print formatting

## 💡 Why I built this:

I wanted to build something useful using simple Python concepts. This project helped me understand how to collect and organize data from users in a structured way.
